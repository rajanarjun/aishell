## aishell 

A experimental pseudo shell where you can ask questions, get command suggestion, explain commands, all from the shell itself, powered by a language model. (for bash currently)

> Think Bash, but with ChatGPT baked in.
* for now it will not run any commands, just behave like a chatbot within a shell
* OpenAI API client or local model integration

just a thought for now, and going about how to implementing it, might be really stupid ...
